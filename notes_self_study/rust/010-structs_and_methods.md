# Structs and Methods

A ***struct*** is a user-defined data type that allows you to create custom data structures by grouping together multiple values under a single name. Like tuples, structs allow you to group together multiple values of different types. But unlike tuples, each value in a struct are not accessed by their indexes, but directly by their name.

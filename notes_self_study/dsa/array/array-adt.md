# Array ADT

- Read element by index: $O(1)$
- Update element by index: $O(1)$
- Search for an element: $O(n)$ (check each element in the array until we found the desired element)
- Insert an element: $O(1)$ if its at the end, and $O(n)$ if its at the beginning or middle.
- Delete an element: $O(1)$ if its at the end, and $O(n)$ if its at the beginning or middle.

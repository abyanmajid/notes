# Mathematical Terminology

*Taken from page 16 of **'Introduction to the Theory of Computation'** by Michael Sipser*

- Alphabet: A finite, nonempty set of objects called symbols
- Argument: An input to a function
- Binary relation: A relation whose domain is a set of pairs
- Boolean operation: An operation on Boolean values
- Boolean value: The values TRUE or FALSE, often represented by 1 or 0
- Cartesian product: An operation on sets forming a set of all tuples of elements from respective sets
- Complement: An operation on a set, forming the set of all elements not present
- Concatenation: An operation that joins strings together
- Conjunction: Boolean AND operation
- Connected graph: A graph with paths connecting every two nodes
- Cycle: A path that starts and ends in the same node
- Directed graph: A collection of points and arrows connecting some pairs of points
- Disjunction: Boolean OR operation
- Domain: The set of possible inputs to a function
- Edge: A line in a graph
- Element: An object in a set
- Empty set: The set with no members
- Empty string: The string of length zero
- Equivalence relation: A binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive
- Function: An operation that translates inputs into outputs
- Graph: A collection of points and lines connecting some pairs of points
- Intersection: An operation on sets forming the set of common elements
- *k*-tuple: A list of k objects
- Language: A set of strings
- Member: An object in a set
- Node: A point in a graph
- Ordered pair: A list of two elements
- Path: A sequence of nodes in a graph connected by edges
- Predicate: A function whose range is {TRUE, FALSE}
- Property: A predicate
- Range: The set from which outputs of a function are drawn
- Relation: A predicate, most typically when the domain is a set of k-tuples
- Sequence: A list of objects
- Set: A group of objects
- Simple path: A path without repetition
- Singleton set: A set with one member
- String: A finite list of symbols from an alphabet
- Symbol: A member of an alphabet
- Tree: A connected graph without simple cycles
- Union: An operation on sets combining all elements into a single set
- Unordered pair: A set with two members
- Vertex: A point in a graph

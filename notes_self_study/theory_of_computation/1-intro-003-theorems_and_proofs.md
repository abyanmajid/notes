## Basic terminology
- **Defintion:** A definition is a description of a certain object or concept. Defitions are used to derive mathematical statements, therefore it is imperative that definitions are clear, because otherwise, there will be trouble in communicating the statements to the readers. For instance, the following is an example of an improper and proper definition of a sample function $D(t)$:
  
  - **Improper definition:** $D(t)$ is a function that models the distance covered by a car.
  - **Proper definition:** $D(t)$, $t_1 \leq t \leq t_2$ is a function that models the distance covered by a car *D* in meters, given time *t* in seconds, and has a domain $[D]=\{t|t_1 \leq t \leq t_2\}$, where $t_1$ is the time when the car starts moving and $t_2$ is the time when it stops.

- **Proof:** A proof is a convincing logical argument that a given mathematical statement is true or false.

- **Theorem:** A theorem is a mathematical statement proved true.

## Automata Theory
Automata Theory tackles the extent at which different machines can process a given **input** and produce an **output**, based on their mathematical models of computation.

One example of the models is the finite automata (*finite automaton*) model, which is a model with a *finite* number of states, hence its name. One example of its application can be found in vending machines, where the output is a finite number of states may include the 'idle/unused' state, 'processing the coins', and 'delivering the drink,' whereas the input is a number of coin. 

## Computability Theory
Computability Theory tackles the extent at which a problem can be solved via computation. So, in computability theory, problems are classified by those of which solution is computable and those that are not. One example of a problem that cannot be solved via computation is the basic problem of determining whether a methematical statement is true or false, which is one amongst many problems that were considered by mathematicians like Godel and Turing.

Another example of an uncomputable problem is the Halting problem, which has a premise of finding a program that, given any input or output, it can decide whether the program will halt or run indefinitely.

## Complexity Theory
Complexity Theory tackles the extent at which the solution of a problem (if it exits) is easy or difficult to compute.

For example, the task of sorting a number by ascending order can and is, by consensus, regarded as an easy computational problem. However, a task like deriving a schedule for an entire university, such that there is no conflicting schedule (e.g. a room is supposedly used by two classes at the same time), is a lot more difficult. Furthermore, its difficulty can even increase depending on the input parameters such as how many students are currently enrolled in the university, how many rooms are there, the number of subjects, if there are special events, and so on.

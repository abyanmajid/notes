# Git repository guidelines

1. Create a separate git repository for every component (eg. for each microservice or whatever unique thing you're building)
2. Create a new branch for every issue (there should be a `main` branch and a lot of feature branches)
3. Use pull requests to merge your code back to `main`
4. Never merge your own pull request! Every pull request is an opportunity for code review!

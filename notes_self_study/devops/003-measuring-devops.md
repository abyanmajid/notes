# Measuring DevOps

## Rewarding what you want to improve

You should measure social interactions! Since you get what you measure, you will get social coders if you measure them by their interactions!

Some metrics to measure social coders:

- Who is leveraging the code you are building? Are you building code that is valuable enough for the company to reuse in their solutions? This will make developers think about how to make their code to be valuable to others
- Whose code are you leveraging? Are you reinventing the wheel or are you building for the bespoke things that do not exist yet? This will incentivise developers to reuse existing solutions.

##  Vanity metrics vs. Actionable metrics

**Vanity metrics** make us feel good, but they don't really tell us anything! For example, "we had 10,000 daily hits to our website!" What exactly does that mean? What actions drove those visitors to you? Did someone click 10,000 times? Or did 10,000 visitors visit once then leave? We don't know what happened and we don't know which actions to take next!

**Actionable metrics** are metrics that tell you what you CLEARLY have to do next! You can do something like A-B testing where group A of consumers receive a feature we're interested in testing, and group B doesn't. Then, if group A generates a higher revenue than group B, then obviously we know to keep this feature around and maybe try to integrate it to other parts of the business!

### Top four actionable metrics

1. Mean lead time (how long does it take for an idea to get to production)
2. Release frequency (deploy a lot!)
3. Change failure rate (how often changes fail; we want to minimize this!)
4. Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## How to measure your team culture

Agree or disagree on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)

- On my team, information  is actively sought (by information, we refer to people being curious why things happen)
- On my team, failures are learning opportunities and messengers of them are not punished
- On my team, responsibilites are shared (i.e., everyone is in this together! when there's a problem, it's everyone's responsibility to solve it!)
- On my team, cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded! (i.e., you're encouraged to try to work with people working on things that aren't directly what you're assigned to)
- On my team, failure causes inquiry towards cause (i.e., failure causes everyone to be driven to find out what was the root cause)
- On my team, new ideas are welcomed! (i.e., do people feel like their ideas are listened to? or were they shut down?)

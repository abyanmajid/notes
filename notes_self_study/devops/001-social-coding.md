# The social coding principle

Social coding is the DevOps solution to improving a suboptimal feature by enforcing the open-source contribution follow to internal projects. It goes something like this:

1. Each product is in its own repository with an owner who has complete control over all changes made to it.
2. As an outsider, you discuss your proposition with the repo owner
3. If both of you agree, then you start by opening an issue and assign it to yourself (so everyone knows you're working on it)
4. Fork the code and make your changes
5. Issue a pull request and the repo owner has to review and can decide whether it should be merged.

This is a much more efficient workflow as supposed to reinventing the entire wheel.

# Pair programming

An aspect of social programming taken from Extreme Programming (XP):

- Two programmers on one workstation
- The driver is typing
- The navigator is reviewing
- Every 20 minutes they switch

### You may think that pair programming is using twice the resources to get the same result, but no, you don't "exactly" get the same results

- Higher code quality
- Defects found ealier
- Lower maintenance costs
- Skills transfer
- Two set of eyes on every line of code
- Broader undestanding of codebase

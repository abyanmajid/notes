One part of a specific Area of Knowledge (AoK) Math assignment assigned to us was to choose an article from a list and explain our perception of it. I stumbled upon an article with the title "New mathematical record: what is the purpose of calculating $\pi$?". It made me ponder the same question: What is the point of calculating $\pi$? This question intrigued me because, in my understanding, an approximate value of $\pi$ to 15 decimal places is more than sufficient for any reasonable purpose. A $\pi$ value with 15 decimal places seems to provide enough reliability for geometry, trigonometry, and even for concepts like Einstein's theory of relativity and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in physics.

What truly signifies the importance of attaining the most accurate value of $\pi$? One thing I knew before clicking the link is that the pursuit of the most precise $\pi$ value may be necessary for the development of advanced computers and programs, such as the application of neural networks for AI. However, in my o$\pi$nion, a staggering 62.8 trillion digits is excessive. This level of accuracy does not inherently offer significant benefits. In fact, a $\pi$ value accurate to 39 decimal places has been proven to be sufficient for solving cosmological problems. Ultimately, the article concludes that achieving such immense accuracy serves primarily as a benchmark to support the advancement of computer hardware, program automation, and other technological advancements.

The TOK Concept 'Value' relates to the article in terms of assessing the usefulness of the new level of $\pi$ accuracy for practical purposes. While 62.8 digits is certainly a noteworthy accomplishment, it raises the question of its practical utility and the extent of its impact. It is argued that this new level of accuracy is nearly useless in most cases, except for its application in automation and computer hardware advancements. The article highlights that this heightened precision in $\pi$ allows for advancements in computing, with calculations being performed 3.5 times faster than the previous record of 50 trillion decimal places. Additionally, it facilitates improvements in the development of computer programs, their efficiency, memory allocation, and other related areas.

In the end, I must admit that this article did not surprise me as much as I initially expected, as the main idea was effectively explained.

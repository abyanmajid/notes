One day, the TOK class was randomly divided into five groups. Each group was tasked with reading an assigned article and completing a worksheet. I was assigned to group 1, and our assigned article revolved around an artist who had been granted £84,000 to reproduce one of their previous artworks. However, despite accepting the money, the artist, Jens Haaning, controversially refused to fulfil the agreement and return the funds to the museum.

According to the article,

 Jens Haaning received 543,000 kroner (£84,000) under the condition that he would recreate two of his previous artworks from 2017 and 2010. These paintings were meant to represent the average annual incomes of an Austrian and a Dane.

However, when the museum received the package, it contained two blank canvases, which constituted a violation of the contractual agreement. Consequently, the museum demanded the return of the money. Nevertheless, Haaning adamantly refused to comply. His reasoning behind the "Take the money and run" approach was twofold: firstly, he would have to spend £3,900 of his own money to recreate the artworks, and secondly, recreating them would undermine the entire essence of the original pieces. Additionally, Haaning argued that his current working conditions were highly inconvenient. As expected, the museum declared that they would take whatever measures necessary to retrieve the funds if Haaning continued to refuse by January 16.

Reading the article made me contemplate the dire working conditions that would prompt Haaning to vehemently hold onto £84,000, particularly when it was legally obligated to be returned. Logically speaking, if Haaning persists in evading repayment, he is likely to face even greater challenges. I found it somewhat perplexing that the article did not offer a clear explanation of Haaning's working conditions, making it difficult for me to fully grasp his predicament. Furthermore, the article sparked my curiosity about the artistic beauty and depth of thought that must have gone into creating the original artworks. Upon finishing the article, I enjoyed envisioning and speculating how Haaning's artworks might have looked and pondering the manner in which he visually depicted the annual income of an Austrian and a Dane. To truly comprehend and wholeheartedly appreciate these old artworks, I believe it would be necessary for me to view them in person. Additionally, the fact that the museum offered Haaning such a substantial sum of money to recreate the pieces implies that they must have possessed an exceptional allure.

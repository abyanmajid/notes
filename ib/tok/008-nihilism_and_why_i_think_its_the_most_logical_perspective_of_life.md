# Nihilism, and why I live by it.

**Nihilism is the belief in nothing.**

Numerous aspects of our world can be subjected to scrutiny and investigation, yet upon questioning their essence, they inevitably disintegrate into nothingness. Consequently, any quest for significance within the vast expanse of the universe leads us to a dearth of objectively truthful answers. This arises from the fundamental fact that you and I are, at the core, human beings — biological entities whose existence is destined to terminate. In the face of mortality, all things lose their purpose. Whether one is in good health or afflicted with a terminal ailment, achieving success or languishing in failure, loved or despised, faithful or atheistic, dedicated to justice or complicit in heinous acts, saviors or destroyers of the world, the impending reality of death renders all endeavours inconsequential. With such inevitability looming over us, one might wonder: why does anything hold significance?

Nihilism liberates us from biases of all kinds. It permits us to perceive life in its most objective form. The simple truth that we are destined to perish eradicates the possibility of an inherent meaning or purpose in life. Some may argue that life presents us with a multitude of opportunities and experiences, but such pursuits fabricate a fictitious significance that crumbles in the face of mortality. There exists no tangible evidence of a higher power, eternal rewards or punishments, an afterlife, or any other notion that suggests an objective purpose. Until irrefutable evidence emerges, it is wise to refrain from subscribing to such nonsensical beliefs. The only rational stance, in the absence of proof, is to embrace a state of disbelief and acknowledge the ultimate futility of our existence.

Nihilism evokes both terror and beauty in equal measure. As a discerning thinker, I opt for rationality and reject any form of faith until concrete evidence emerges. Consequently, I must confront the disconcerting notion that my struggles and hardships amount to futile endeavours. The weight of this realization is, quite frankly, overwhelming, instilling a profound sense of horror as it renders everything I do seemingly devoid of meaning. In fact, I contend that the core concept of nihilism is more distressing than pessimism (the belief in the worst possible outcomes) precisely because pessimism, albeit undesirable, still implies a purpose. Nihilism, on the other hand, offers nothing at all. Yet, through experiencing the horrors of nihilism, I have arrived at an intriguing revelation: nihilism can also be a source of optimism, and it is within this realm that it acquires a certain beauty. It proposes that if everything is genuinely devoid of meaning, then we possess the freedom to pursue whatever we desire — an unparalleled form of liberty for creatures like us, humans, constrained by limited free will. It is freedom that knows no bounds.

As an optimistic nihilist, I embrace the understanding that my life is devoid of ultimate meaning. Nevertheless, considering that my existence is destined for its inevitable conclusion, why should anyone or anything in the cosmos concern themselves with my actions? I am liberated. I live life on my own terms, fully cognizant of its inherent meaninglessness, and have recently come to realize that despite its lack of purpose, the world is also exquisitely beautiful. Our lives, bereft of ultimate significance, are unequivocally worth living.

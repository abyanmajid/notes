# What are some problems that only religion can solve?

At present, my perspective aligns with the notion that religion fails to provide solutions to any quandary. Religion, in essence, serves to uphold the plausibility of the existence of a deity or any divine entity governing the universe, time, and conceivably ourselves, however improbable this may be. Beyond this aspect, religion can undoubtedly offer solace or afford individuals an artificial sense of purpose, such as devotion to a higher power or community. Nonetheless, from a logical standpoint, the latter point likely holds little relevance. This is due to the fact that it applies to any other facet or circumstance in life or within our vast cosmos. Anything can imbue life with meaning, provided that the meaning is subjective, peculiar to oneself alone, rather than objective.

Religion has never contributed a single logical conjecture aside from postulating the improbable prospect of an afterlife, the existence of a god, or the concepts of heaven and hell, as expounded in various religious doctrines. If anything, I am of the belief that religion engenders more predicaments, and quite a substantial number of them at that. In my opinion, the most significant predicament is that it impedes religious individuals, even those with only a slight inclination towards religiosity, from questioning their beliefs and consequently prevents them from engaging in rational thinking. This conviction stems from my belief that if we, as a species, aspire to seek an objective purpose for our lives, it is imperative that we all adopt a rational mindset. Only then can we make genuine progress in scientific research and our understanding of the cosmos at a fruitful pace.

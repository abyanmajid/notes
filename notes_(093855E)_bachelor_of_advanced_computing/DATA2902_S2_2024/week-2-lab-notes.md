# Week 2 Lab (DATA2902)

**Australian road fatalities**

Questions to ask of the data, and a visualization to answer each:

1. Is there specific times of the day when road fatalities are more common? (Bar chart)
2. How has the frequency of road fatalities in Australia changed over the years? (Scatter plot and line of best fit)
3. Which age group is most commonly represented among these people involved in road fatalities? (Boxplot or Barchart)

Probable confounders:

- Weather at the time
- The structure of the road (is it straight, is it going upwards, downwards)
- Whether or not the driver's on alcohol or drugs
- Are they wearing seatbelts?
- Were they on the phone as they drive?

**Cereal**

Questions to ask of the data, and a visualization to answer each:

1. Which cereal has the highest nutritional value e.g., highest amount of protein, fiber, vitamin (Stacked bar chart)
2. Is there a correlation between rating and the amount of sugar? (Scatter plot, line of best fit)
3. What are the most common nutritional deficiencies in cereals? (Histogram)

Probable confounders:

- Portion size
- The type of the cereal (oat, granola, flake, bran)
- Brand and packaging (it might influence the rating)
- Current dietary trends e.g., low carb, gluten-free, etc (it might also influence the rating)

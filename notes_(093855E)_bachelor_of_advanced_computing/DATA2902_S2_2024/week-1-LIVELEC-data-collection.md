**Bias:**

Bias is any factor that favours certain outcomes or responses, or influences an individual's responses. It can be accidental, or intentional (so as to achieve certain results)

- _Selection bias / sampling bias:_ The sample doesn't accurately represent the population e.g., attendees at a star trek conventionmay report that their favourite genre is science fiction.

- _Non-response bias:_ Certain groups are under-represented because they decide not to participate e.g., restaurant gives "customer satisfaction survey" to each table, but customers may not respond.

- _Measurement bias:_ Inaccuracies in the sampling method influence the data obtained e.g., a respondent may answer questions in the way they think the question wants them to answer.

**Randomised controlled double-blind trials:**

**Bias:**

Bias is any factor that favours certain outcomes or responses, or influences an individual's responses. It can be accidental, or intentional (so as to achieve certain results)

- _Selection bias / sampling bias:_ The sample doesn't accurately represent the population e.g., attendees at a star trek conventionmay report that their favourite genre is science fiction.

- _Non-response bias:_ Certain groups are under-represented because they decide not to participate e.g., restaurant gives "customer satisfaction survey" to each table, but customers may not respond.

- _Measurement bias:_ Inaccuracies in the sampling method influence the data obtained e.g., a respondent may answer questions in the way they think the question wants them to answer.

**Randomised controlled double-blind trials:**

1. Investigators obtain a representative sample of subjects and randomly allocate them into a TREATMENT GROUP and a CONTROL GROUP
2. The treatment group is given the TREATMENT. Meanwhile, the control group is given a PLACEBO.
3. The investigator compares the responses of the 2 groups.

It MUST be the case that neither the subjects nor the investigator know of the identity of both groups (hence why it's called DOUBLE-BLIND).

A good randomised controlled experiment can establish _causation._

**Observational studies:**

A lot of RQs require an observational study, more so than a controlled experiment e.g., when studying the effect of smoking we simply CANNOT allocate people to the treatment group (make them smoke). Rather, we must observe medical results for 2 groups. 

An observational study CANNOT establish causation. It may only suggest association.

**Hidden confounders:**

Confounding occurs when the treatment group and control group differ by some third variable which influences the result of the study. Confounders can be hard to find!

Example: If not all subjects are taking the treatment or placebo during all times, then we get the confounding of adherers and non-adherers.

**Controlling for confounding:**

We can control for confounders by dividing our subjects into subgroups. For example, if alcohol consumption is a potential confounder in a study of smoking's affect on liver cancer, then we can "control for alcohol consumption" by dividing our subjects into 3 groups:

- heavy drinkers
- medium drinkers
- light drinkers

**Simpson's Paradox:**

When groups are pooled together, there is sometimes a disappearing of data, and that causes the trend to be "reversed".

e.g., Treatment A is more effective than Treatment B for both men and women when analyzed separately. However, when the data for both genders are combined, treatment B appears more effective overall!

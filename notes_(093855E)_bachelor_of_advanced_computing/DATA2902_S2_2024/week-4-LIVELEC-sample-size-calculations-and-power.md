Taking the example of innocence vs. guilty where $H_0$ states that the person is innocent:

- Type I Error ($\alpha$): Rejecting $H_0$, but $H_0$ is actually correct. That is, we conclude the person is guilty, when in fact they are innocent.
- Type II Error ($\beta$): NOT rejecting $H_0$, but $H_0$ is actually incorrect. That is, we conclude the person is innocent, when in fact they are guilty.
- Power: $1-\beta=P(\text{reject }H_0|H_1\text{ true})$

# study-notes
Hi, this repository lists all of my study notes, most of which are products of active recall :)

## Overview
This repository includes:
- Notes for my IB (International Baccalaureate) subjects
- Notes for my Bachelor's degree on *Advanced Computing (093855E)* at the University of Sydney

When you read my notes, remember that I am only human, so **there will be errors**. Therefore, be sure to take the good, and leave the bad !<

This repository lists all of my study notes - most of which are products of active recall - written in LaTeX and Markdown. (Do keep in mind that my notes do not undergo professional verification, therefore I beg that you scrutinize as you read)

I often make summaries of things I had learned (in a teaching manner) using LaTeX or Markdown - and i thought it would be nice to collect all of them in a single repository.

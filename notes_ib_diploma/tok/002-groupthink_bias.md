# Groupthink Bias

One who possesses such biases tends to allow the group to veer away from the optimal decision. Such decisions are typically devoid of logical reasoning and critical thinking. Individuals affected by such biases may perceive alternative options as more efficient, yet still end up conforming to the majority.

### My Experience
Personally, I am aware that within myself there exists a strong inclination to eliminate all possibilities and arrive at the best solution when solving a problem. I consistently apply this approach, particularly when tackling challenges on my own. However, when working in a group, I seldom express my opinions and ideas openly. Consequently, there have been instances where I have deferred to the decisions of the group, despite recognizing that a better idea exists.

One memorable occurrence took place during a group project in my ninth-grade year. I was assigned to collaborate with a few classmates in order to create a short film. In this project, I assumed the role of the film director. During our shooting sessions, I keenly observed the cameraperson's techniques, taking note of factors such as shooting angles and variety of perspectives. However, I occasionally refrained from informing them if their approach was ineffective. As a result, the final version of the movie did not match the grand vision I had initially envisioned in my mind.

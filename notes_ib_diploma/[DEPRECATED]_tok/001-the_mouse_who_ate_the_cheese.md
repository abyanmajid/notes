# The Mouse Who Ate the Cheese

The mouse that consumed the cheese became a subject of discussion during one of our TOK meetings, presenting itself as a case study. It unfolded as a brief tale featuring a mouse indulging in cheese at a gathering. Among the attendees, only Bill bore witness to this act. He, being in a state of complete sobriety, possessed unwavering consciousness. Consequently, he possessed absolute certainty that the mouse did indeed consume the cheese, as he had personally observed it. Nevertheless, the question arises as to what extent Bill can substantiate this claim to others.

**The answer is: He cannot.**

Bill endeavoured to persuade three other individuals present at the gathering: Alice, Adrian, and George. As a result, we confront a quandary concerning true knowledge, belief, and evidence. Bill managed to convince Alice and Adrian that the mouse had indeed consumed the cheese. However, the predicament lies in the fact that their agreement stemmed from their faith in Bill's judgement. Thus, they lack genuine knowledge regarding whether or not the mouse consumed the cheese, as faith merely serves as an evaluative tool brimming with irrational certainty. Conversely, George remains unconvinced by Bill's assertions. Since the event took place at George's abode, he perceives himself as the most familiar with the surroundings. In this instance, George does not rely on faith like the other two individuals. However, how can he be so certain that the mouse did not consume the cheese? Does his certainty stem solely from his lack of firsthand observation?

In my interpretation, none of the arguments presented by Bill, Alice, Adrian, or George can be OBJECTIVELY proven. As long as Alice, Adrian, and George did not personally witness the mouse consuming the cheese (i.e. visually perceive it), Bill is unable to present any form of evidence that guarantees absolute certainty. The same applies to George; in his insistence that the mouse did not consume the cheese, he cannot furnish any evidence that definitively supports his claim. This stems from his lack of observation of the mouse and the cheese, raising doubts about his ability to evaluate and arrive at such a conclusion.

This case study captivated my interest significantly because it possesses potential applicability to various scenarios. For instance, if theists believe in the existence of a God governing the universe's course, can they substantiate this belief? Likewise, atheists adopt the contrary viewpoint (i.e. the non-existence of a deity controlling the universe), but can they also substantiate their stance?

As long as we and the individuals we seek to enlighten do not personally perceive phenomena, none of us can objectively prove anything.

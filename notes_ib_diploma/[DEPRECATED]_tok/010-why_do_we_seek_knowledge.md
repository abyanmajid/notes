# Why do we seek knowledge?

For the final assignment of the first semester in TOK, my classmates and I were tasked with individually composing an essay exploring a topic from a provided list. Among the options, the one that particularly intrigued me at the time was "Why do we seek knowledge?" Although it has been a few months since I completed and submitted the essay, I find it fascinating how my standpoint and perspective have undergone significant transformation. This time, I have arrived at a markedly different conclusion, to be frank.

Readers familiar with my writings on controversial subjects such as religion, science, life, and death might observe a recurring feature, which is that my arguments consistently lead to a nihilistic standpoint. Admittedly, this presents a predicament, as any conclusion stemming from nihilism lacks inherent meaning. Consequently, my claims and arguments prove ineffectual. Nonetheless, I cannot help but be drawn to nihilism, as it appears to me as the most rational ideology and worldview regarding life and the universe.

This inclination extends to the aforementioned essay. In the past, I posited that our pursuit of knowledge arises from a combination of problem-solving and our innate curiosity. We seek knowledge because we simply cannot exist without doing so. Naturally, this proposition lacks objectivity since a human being can subsist by merely quenching their thirst and nourishing themselves, without actively acquiring new knowledge. From a philosophical standpoint, however, is such an existence considered "living" or merely "surviving"? Personally, I hold the view that true survival entails more than mere sustenance; it necessitates engaging in activities beyond the basic needs. Inevitably, such engagement involves the acquisition, if not the pursuit, of knowledge, particularly given the universe's myriad mysteries that science has yet to unravel.

As I mentioned previously, my perspective on the topic has undergone substantial transformation in recent months. As of this writing, which is towards the end of February 2022, I incline towards the belief that we, as humans, seek knowledge out of a desperate yearning for a singular, objectively correct answer in this utterly absurd universe. Admittedly, this conclusion may appear unduly pessimistic and excessively extreme. Nonetheless, I maintain that, because so far, I think vit represents the most logical response to the question at hand. Consider, what happens when our curiosity becomes "too intense"? In such cases, we inevitably find ourselves incessantly questioning, striving to validate the accuracy of our conclusions. Now, if we disregard any elements that could compromise the rationality of our conclusions (that is, remaining impervious to subjectivity), we are destined to encounter an absence of any objective answer. This is when curiosity transitions into desperation.

Those who have reached this juncture, grounded solely in rational thinking, will perpetually yearn for an answer that is unequivocally and comprehensively correct in all aspects. However, thus far, no such answer has been attained. Nonetheless, we persist in our pursuit of knowledge. But why do we persist? Well... the truth is, we do not know, do we? Despite the possibility that truth may elude us entirely, we still move forward, still ceaselessly searching for meaning.

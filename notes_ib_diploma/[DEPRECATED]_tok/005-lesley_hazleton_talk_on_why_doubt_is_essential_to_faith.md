In one of our classes centered around knowledge and religion, we were introduced to Lesley Hazleton's thought-provoking Ted talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ORDQFh0Byw&ab_channel=TED). The talk delves into Hazleton's belief that doubt plays a vital role in the realm of faith. Having watched the video, I wholeheartedly concur with her perspective.

Lesley Hazleton presents the notion that doubt holds significant value within faith, allowing individuals to scrutinize their beliefs, as well as the ideas and values they adopt from their chosen religion. She argues that doubt enables us to engage in rational thinking to some extent, thereby serving as a deterrent to fundamentalist and irrational acts. An example she mentions is how some individuals, motivated by their religious convictions, commit acts of terrorism under the belief that they are fighting in the name of Allah. Thus, Hazleton's underlying message seems to emphasize the importance of embracing doubt as a means to prevent irrational religious acts, ones rooted in divine intentions such as protecting God's name or making sacrifices for God. It is worth noting that she acknowledges the higher likelihood of such movements being flawed.

As a rational thinker, I strive to approach matters with logic and reason, although I readily admit that I am not always flawless in this pursuit. While I was born into the Islamic faith, I have experienced periods of doubt over the years, particularly in recent times. I have explored other religions and, upon reflection, arrived at the conclusion that Islam, like any other man-made religion, contains numerous contradictions. This personal journey of questioning my initial beliefs and recognizing the potential benefits of abandoning them is something I believe all theists should undertake. To clarify, I am not attempting to persuade theists to embrace atheism. Rather, I advocate for theists to confront the flaws within their respective religions and acknowledge that engaging in so-called "religious movements" to defend their God and faith is unwarranted. It is perfectly acceptable to maintain one's religious beliefs for reasons such as comfort or personal fulfillment. However, it bewilders me how deeply religion has entrenched itself in the minds of many religious individuals, rendering them unwilling to entertain the possibility that their convictions may be fallible after all.

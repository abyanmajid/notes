### The 1st Tuesday: The World

- Morrie was in a wheelchair and his legs had atrophied beyond normal clothing size
- Mitch brought food and ate it together with Morrie on the day
- Morrie deems having someone to, one day, wipe his bottom as an ultimate sign of dependency. But he claimed that he’s trying his best to enjoy the process (i.e. he gets to be a baby once more)
- Morrie often cries, but Mitch never cries. It is okay to cry.
- The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.
- Love is the only rational act

### The 2nd Tuesday: Feeling Sorry for Yourself**

- The newspaper situation in Detroit was growing insane—nasty confrontations between picketers and replacement workers, people arrested, beaten—and it made Mitch feel that his visits with Morrie were a cleansing rinse of human kindness.
- By now, Morrie couldn’t lift his arms much higher than his chest and he spent more time in his study room where he had his reclining chair to help him support his withered legs.
- Morrie mourns in the morning, but eventually stops and lives the day. He cries when he needs it, but then concentrates on the better things left in his life.
- Morrie considers himself as lucky. He sees the time he has left before the disease would kill him as a chance to say goodbye.
- To have people trust you, you must first believe that you can trust them.

### The 3rd Tuesday: Regrets

- Mitch supposes that tapes, photographs, and videos are desperate attempts to steal something from a death’s suitcase. Pop culture does not encourage one to think about the most important things in life until they’re about to die. One usually needs a teacher, or someone to probe them in that direction

### The 4th Tuesday: Death

- By now, Morrie had been attaching a long plastic tubing from an oxygen machine to his nose to help with his breathing during night times.
- Everyone knows they’re going to die, but nobody believes it.
- The Detroit newspaper strikes were showing the solidarity of unions against management. Mitch also read about a woman who had shot her husband and two daughters as they lay sleeping, claiming she was protecting them from bad people
- One should be prepared for death at any time in order to be more involved in their life while they’re living. To be prepared, Morrie suggests that one should do what the Buddhists do, every day, ask yourself:
    - Am I ready?
    - Am I doing all I need to do?
    - Am I being the person I want to be?
    - Is today the day I die?
- Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live. Death strips away the less important things in life and makes you focus on the essentials.
- We all tend to take many things for granted

### The 5th Tuesday: Family

- Mitch switched handheld microphones with lavaliere microphones that can be clipped onto a collar because Morrie could no longer hold anything for a long period.
- The poet Auden once said: “Love each other or perish.” ‘Without love, we are birds with broken wings’, Morrie said.
- Friends come and go, but family stays with you forever.
- Mitch’s generation seems to struggle with the idea of having children. It’s as if children are something that can tie one down. Something to add to one’s list of troubles.
- Morrie insists that there is no other experience that can replace the happiness you can get from having children. However, there is a price to pay for having children and that is: You, one day, will be leaving them.
- Morrie has two sons, they’re named Rob and Jon.
- Mitch had a younger brother who was faced with the unfortunate fate of getting cancer. He flew to Europe to get all sorts of treatments and fought against cancer for 5 years. He was able to chase the disease away with the help of an experimental drug available in Spain. However, Mitch was annoyed by the fact that his brother had denied his right to help him in any way.

### The 6th Tuesday: Emotions

- By now, Morrie can only consume soft food and liquid drinks. He hadn’t eaten most if not all the food Mitch brought for him during the previous meeting.
- Learn to detach; Do not cling to things, because everything is impermanent.
    - Example: Morrie is terrified of his disease. He is terrified each time he felt his chest locked in heaving surges. He fears the future, he wonders in horror when will he have his last breath. But all of those are ONLY fear. He only needs to recognize the fear and then step away from it. Detach.
- Morrie wants to die serenely, not in a state of horror (e.g. in the middle of a coughing spell). To guarantee this, Morrie thinks that he needs to be able to detach from the fear and say, ‘This is my moment’. By then, he’d be able to die serenely regardless of the circumstances.

### The 7th Tuesday: The Fear of Aging

- Morrie can no longer wipe his own bottom. At first, he was ashamed and it took time to get used to it. But he figured that he should just **forget what the culture says**. What’s there to be ashamed about?... Morrie then started to like his **dependency**. It felt as if he was going back to being a child.
- Morrie does not think that youth is as great as what pop culture portrays it to be. **Morrie embraces **ageing. Morrie thinks that ageing resembles growth, not just the fear of death. When one gets older, they’d learn more about life, and eventually understand their fear of death and try to live a better, more fulfilling life.
- It is a fact that each of us is going to die. Having said that, fear is but an obstacle in the process of searching for meaning in life.

### The 8th Tuesday: Money

- ‘We put our values in the wrong things which leads to disillusioned lives,’ Morrie said
- Morrie said, ‘**Money or power is not a substitute for tenderness’.** When you most need it, like how Morrie is sitting and dying, neither money nor power can give you the feeling you’re looking for.
- Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.
- Status will get you nowhere, only an open heart will allow you to float equally among everyone.

### The 9th Tuesday: How Love Goes On

- By this point, Morrie’s legs needed constant tending and he is unable to move his head. Morrie made a new aphorism about it, **‘**When you’re in bed, you’re dead**’**
- Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone (e.g. Mitch hears Morrie’s voice at times when he’s somewhere else. Whenever he does so, it signifies that Morrie is alive and was alive when he is dead.
- Be fully present when you are interacting with someone.
- Better to respond to a negative input with love, rather than starting a chain of hatred by responding with another negative input. (e.g. Morrie—when he used to be able to drive—would wave his hand and smile to a person who wants to get ahead of him in the traffic)
- What we take, we must replenish.

### The 10th Tuesday: Marriage

- On the 10th Tuesday, Mitch brought his wife to meet Morrie**.**
- By now, Morrie could no longer lift a phone by himself. His sleeping time and coughing spells were getting worse, and he needed oxygen almost every night.
- In pop culture, it’s very important to find a loving relationship because not a lot of people can give you that. So many people does not even know themselves, let alone what they want in a partner. Many would be too selfish to get a partner or rush a marriage only to find themselves incompatible and be divorced.
- A lover is very important. Friends come and go, but a lover would be by your side regardless of your or their issues.
- A few rules about love and marriage Morrie knows to be true are as follows:
    - You must respect your partner
    - You must know how to compromise
    - You mustn’t hide anything that is going on/happening between you and your partner.
    - You must have a common set of values in life, and your values must preferably be alike to your partner’s.
        - The most important value is your belief in the importance of your marriage
- Morrie personally believes that marriage is a very important thing to do, and one would miss a lot of things if one chose to pass on marriage.
- Love each other or perish

### The 11th Tuesday: Culture

- By now, Morrie needs to have the poison in his lungs to be regularly bang loose, in order to prevent it from solidifying; to keep him breathing.
- Mitch describes Morrie’s disease by the 11th Tuesday as dangerously close to his **surrender spot**, the lungs.
- Morrie believed in the inherent good of people
- People are only mean when they’re threatened, which is what the pop culture and the economic system of the world do to us.
- By creating one’s own culture, Morrie didn’t mean that one should abandon all values posed by pop culture, especially the little ones such as wearing clothes in public. However, the bigger, more relevant ones such as what one thinks and what they value, should be determined by them and themselves only. Not the society. Not anyone else.
- Morrie thinks that one should create their own culture rather than escape/run away from the pop culture
- Morrie thinks that we do not see others as equivalents. We’d realize that all of us are humans and all of us die. If we can start to see ourselves as humans instead of whites and blacks, men and women, rich and poor, we might just be ONE big human family on earth and there would be minimal need for conflicts.
- Morrie thinks that we always need the help of others to survive throughout the entirety of our lives.
- The trial of the century ended with the conclusion that O. J Simpson was not guilty.

### The 12th Tuesday: Forgiveness

- Forgive yourself before you die, then forgive others
- By the 12th Tuesday, Morrie was unable to wiggle his toes, and yet he could still feel physical pain. Massages help relieve the pain.
- There’s no point in keeping vengeance, stubbornness, and pride. Learn to forgive.
- Forgive yourself, because beating yourself up over regrets would not do any good.

### The 13th Tuesday: The Perfect Day

- Morrie wanted to be cremated
- By the 13th Tuesday, Morrie was coughing all the time
- People act as if death is contagious when it is as natural as life. People think because they’re humans, they are something above and greater than nature.
- Making peace with living is much harder than making peace with living.
- As long as we can love each other, we can die without ever really going away. Because your love will carry in the hearts and lives of those you’ve shown it to.
- Death ends a life, not a relationship.
- There is no formula for solving relationship issues. They have to be negotiated in loving ways.
- Love is when you are as concerned about someone else’s situation as you are about your own
- A wave is part of the ocean. They bob along in the ocean but eventually crash against the shore. Humans are no different. Humans live but eventually, die, for humans are part of nature.

### The 14th Tuesday: We Say Goodbye

- Mitch still brought food—soup, vegetable cakes, and tuna salad—even though he was aware that Morrie hadn’t eaten food in months. He still did it anyways because it had become a small tradition. Sometimes, when you’re losing someone, you hang on to whatever tradition you can.
- Morrie by the 14th Tuesday was so withered that he looked as small as a child.
- Morrie struggled with his breathing so much that he could barely speak.
- Mitch didn’t know how to say goodbye. Morrie patted Mitch’s hand and kept it on his chest, saying “This is how we say goodbye”.
- Mitch brought a tape recorder that day but didn’t ever use it. He wonders why did he even bring it in the first place.

### Morrie’s death

Morrie died on a Saturday morning. He fell into a coma two days after Mitch’s last visit. He hung on until the fourth of November when those he loved left the room to grab a coffee, he stopped breathing. Mitch likes to believe that he did that on purpose, for that way, he had died the way he wanted, with nobody to be haunted by it. Unlike his mother’s death and his father’s corpse in the city morgue. Morrie died serenely.
